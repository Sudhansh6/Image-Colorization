## Linear Regression
The main aim is to estimate a linear equation representing the given set of data. There are two approaches to this.   
1. A closed form solution.  
   This can be directly obtained by solving the linear differential equation.
2. An iterative approach.  
    This is similar to **Gradient Descent**. We try to obtain the minima (L1, L2 norm etc) by calculating the gradient at each point and moving in small steps along the gradient vector.
